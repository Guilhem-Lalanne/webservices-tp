Bundle creation :

$ php bin/console generate:bundle

It did not work properly, I had to fix composer.json, and add manually the bundle.
(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45242838/symfony-3-bundle-creation-always-throws-edit-the-composer-json-file)

And then, reload autoload :
$ composer dump-autoload
